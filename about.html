          Previously, I was a two time software engineering intern at Google. I was also as a software engineering intern

          At Brown, I enjoyed teaching - I was a Head TA for CSCI 0160: Data Structures and Algorithms and a TA for CSCI 0320: Introduction to Software Engineering. I also *almost* got
